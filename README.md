A robot, to help me play web-game: Ogame.

Can automatically perform:

* Carpet Spy

* Risk Assessment

* Fleet Organize, make sure every ship you have is making profit, all the time.

* Carpet Loot

* Colonial Recommendations, To discover Archon's full potential, follow Archon's advise and expand your base accordingly.

* Retaliate Avoidance

* Auto Auction (Don't be too greedy, might get caught)

* ...

With Archon, My account surpass 95% player (rank list) in a 2 years old server, in 3 month.

This is obviously cheating and is NOT welcomed in game playing, it's already too late by the time I realized that.
